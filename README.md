Individual Assignment 3
Transaction Form. and Software Installer
IMPORTANT NOTE:
This assignment continues from the work you have done in “Individual Assignment 1  2”.
You are required to re-use same Visual Basic Project that you created for “Individual Assignment 1  2”, or use an improved version of the same Visual Basic Project for “Individual Assignment 1  2”:
1. You will use the same topic that was previously assigned to you in “Individual Assignment 1”.
2. All windows forms that you previously created for “Individual Assignment 1  2” must be used, or be improved.
3. The database file that you previously created for “Individual Assignment 1  2” must be used, or be improved.
4. The pictures that you have previously collected for “Individual Assignment 1  2” must be used.
5. You will add new windows forms required for this assignment to your previous Visual Basic Project.
6. Evaluation of “Individual Assignment 3” will only be made on the following Tasks:
ASSIGNMENT 3 will be evaluated using your final program that is installed using your SETUP.EXE installer only, and no longer through Visual Studio.
TASK 1: Build a form. for the user to MAKE ORDERS for multiple products.
1. The ORDER for multiple products must be made in a single form, using a single ORDER ID.
2. The MAKE ORDER form. must show/display calculated values such as SUB-TOTALS and TOTALS. However, these calculated values do not need to be stored in the database.
3. The ORDER for products must be processed as a TRANSACTION.
4. When entering data into the MAKE ORDER form, all items in the order must be successfully COMMITed into the database, or ROLLED-BACK completely if there is an error.
 IMPORTANT: Your evaluator will test ACID compliance of your ORDER TRANSACTION by deliberately causing an error when entering data for the order.

TASK 2: Build a form. that the user can use to VIEW existing ORDERS.
1. This VIEW ORDER form. is only used to look at existing ORDERS already in the database, and to look at the list of products ordered in each ORDER.
2. Both your MAKE ORDER form. and VIEW ORDER form. should look something like FIGURE 1 (it does not need to be identical).   →
TASK 3: Create an INSTALLER for your program and a Splash Screen (i.e. main product title screen)
1. Use a “Setup and Deployment” project in Visual Studio to create the installer.
 IMPORTANT: “Express” versions of Visual Studio do not have the “Setup and Deployment” project option.
2. Make sure there is a Desktop shortcut for executing your installed program.
3. Design your Splash Screen appropriately to suit your individual topic. You will also be evaluated based on the aesthetics and appearance of your Splash Screen.
4. Make sure your FULL NAME, MATRIC NUMBER and SHOP/PROJECT NAME are labeled on the Splash Screen.
TASK 4: Create a *.ZIP/*.RAR containing your project’s contents, and upload it to UKMfolio (*see NOTE below).
1. Compress the following folders in a single *.ZIP/*.RAR file:
a. One folder labelled as _SOURCECODE, that contains you entire VB project source code, database, and pictures.
b. One folder labelled as _INSTALLER, that contains your program’s SETUP.EXE file and installer (*.msi) files (i.e. everything in the ‘Debug’ directory of your “Setup and Deployment”).
5. *** IMPORTANT ***: Your *.ZIP/*.RAR must not exceed 125mb (Megabytes). If it does exceed 125mb, you need to reduce the resolution of all your pictures, in order to reduce their file size.
6. Upload your *.ZIP/*.RAR file to UKMfolio, at the Lab Assignment 3 Submission Link.
